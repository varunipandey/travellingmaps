        "Home to one of the world’s richest and oldest civilizations, India is awash with different cultures, religions, peoples, and traditions. It is this diversity that makes it so mesmerizing to explore. While the Himalayas dominate the north, steamy jungle, picturesque tea plantations, and gorgeous beaches can be found in the rest of the country. Tucked away among these varied landscapes are millennia-old archaeological sites and colorful yet chaotic cities such as Mumbai and New Delhi. From temples to cuisine and history to wildlife, the world’s second-most populous country has something for everyone. The only question is where to begin."

        "Thanks to its breathtaking beaches, glittering temples, and welcoming population, Thailand is a very popular tourist destination. Fittingly enough, it is often called ‘the Land of Smiles.’ While Bangkok has lots of fantastic cuisine and nightlife on offer, Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai are home to some of the nation’s most famous temples. Further afield, you can find wild jungle, picturesque paddy fields, and quiet and secluded towns and villages. Lying in between the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand, its golden sands and underwater marvels attract hordes of people every year. Many also come to party in its beachside towns, visit idyllic islands such as Ko Tao, or enjoy the stunning scenery at Krabi."

Lying to the east of mainland Asia, the island nation is a fascinating place as old and new collide wherever you go. While the futuristic metropolises of Tokyo and Yokohama are full of skyscrapers and neon lights, Kyoto and Nara instead boast traditional palaces and age-old temples. Covered in mountains and forests, the country is also home to some delightful nature and scenery. This explains why the vast majority of its large population is found in the densely populated cities that hug its long and indented coastline."

This represents a marked change, as for much of its history, it has been overlooked and outshone by its larger and more powerful neighbors China and Japan. What makes traveling around the peninsula so fascinating is that the nation boasts a rich and unique history, heritage, and culture. It has, however, modernized rapidly. You’ll find centuries-old palaces and temples alongside skyscrapers and gigantic shopping malls. Deceptively mountainous, South Korea also has lots of marvelous national parks for you to explore, with beautiful islands and beaches hugging the shore. Of these, Jeju Island is the most popular to visit among locals and tourists alike."
